## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can fork this uh thing and probably enhance it, i don't really mind

wanna host the bot? go to the [wiki](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/wiki) tab!

wanna go straight into it? run `curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soswav/bigrat/main/quickinstall.sh ~/Downloads && cd ~/Downloads && chmod u+x quickinstall.sh && ./quickinstall.sh` on linux! this will always be updated, so you can run the script for an update! though, you should probably save your token 'cause it's gonna delete old files!

github.com/wascertified is the COWOWENR!!! PROPS TO EM'! also thanks really much dud!

note: read the stuff with the "#" on the beginnig as they can be helpful if you're as clueless as me!
