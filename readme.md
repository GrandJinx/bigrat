## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can fork this uh thing and probably enhance it, i don't really mind

wanna host the bot?
jsut clone the `bot.py` file and edit it to your needs, but first change the `TOKEN = 'token'` part (example: TOKEN = 'tokengoeshere')
the bot will log the guilds it has been invited to by default, you can disable thhat! jsut remove the lines that log that stuff and youre done!

then run 
`python /path/to/file.py` and it turns on bot
