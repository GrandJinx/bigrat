## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can fork this uh thing and probably enhance it, i don't really mind

wanna host the bot?

jsut clone the `bot.py` file and edit it to your needs, but first change the `TOKEN = 'token'` part (example: TOKEN = 'tokengoeshere')

the bot will log the guilds it has been invited to by default, you can disable thhat! jsut remove the lines that log that stuff and youre done!

then run 

`python /path/to/file.py` and it turns on the bot

(you will also need to download stuff with pip) 

uh, here's a shortcut if you use linux: `cd ~/ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soswav/bigrat/main/bot.py && nano ~/bot.py`
