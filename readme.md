## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can fork this uh thing and probably enhance it, i don't really mind

wanna host the bot?

go to https://soswav/bigrat then click "Code" then "download zip"!!!





then run 

`python /path/to/file.py` and it turns on the bot

(you will also need to download stuff with pip, it should be on the bot.py file) 


github.com/wascertified is the COWOWENR!!! PROPS TO EM'! also thanks really much dud!

note: read the stuff with the "#" on the beginnig as they can be helpful if you're as clueless as me!
