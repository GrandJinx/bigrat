## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can fork this uh thing and probably enhance it, i don't really mind

wanna host the bot?

jsut clone the `bot.py` file and edit it to your needs, but first you need to config ur bot in the config.json file



the bot will log the guilds it has been invited to by default, you can disable thhat! jsut remove the lines that log that stuff and youre done!

then run 

`python /path/to/file.py` and it turns on the bot

(you will also need to download stuff with pip) 

uh, here's a shortcut if you use linux: `cd ~/ && curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/soswav/bigrat/main/bot.py && nano ~/bot.py`

github.com/wascertified is the COWOWENR!!! PROPS TO EM'! also thanks really much dud!

note: read the stuff with the "#" on the beginnig as they can be helpful if you're as clueless as me!

this truely is the *silliest* thing ever
