## bigrat
repository for the poorly coded discord bot, big rat

the bot currently has like 13 commands? i don't know
you can probably fork this thing and enhance it (like a lot)

im still trying to find ideas for commands but [SOMEONE](https://github.com/wascertified/) keeps adding commands!!!! (i'm jelaoalous, i also don't really have ideas)

wanna *know* how to host the *bot*? go to the [wiki](https://github.com/soswav/bigrat/wiki)!

[wascertified](https://github.com/wascertified/) is the co-owner!!! thank yu so much dude!

note: read the stuff with the "#" on the beginnig as they can be helpful if you're as clueless as me!

another note: i'm firkcing depressed ☹️
